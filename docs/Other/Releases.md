# WebKit Releases

## Apple Platforms

Once a change lands in the WebKit repository it will follow a process before it is available to customers.

1. The patch will first be available in Safari Technology Preview (STP) for feedback and testing.
2. Next, it will appear in Safari Betas for further testing.
3. Finally, it will be available to customers in a release of Safari.

The exact timelines for each patch to move to the next step will vary based on a variety of factors including performance impact, number of bugs found, the time in the release cycle, etc...
Generally though a patch will start its journey in STP only a few weeks after it lands on trunk.

WebKit traditionally ships from trunk three times a year (Fall, Winter, and Spring). 
These three releases will have all the latest changes from the WebKit repository, while other releases will mainly focus on bug fixes.
Just to note though, just because a feature is in a WebKit release it may be disabled or hidden behind a feature flag based on testing and feedback.
