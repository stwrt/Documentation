# Caching

## Memory Cache

The memory cache is a temporary cache that lives in the WebContent process and serves as a fast lookup of cached content. This data is only available as long as the process is alive, and once the process dies the memory cache is cleared.

## Network Cache

The network cache is a long term cache that is stored to disk and lives in the network process.
